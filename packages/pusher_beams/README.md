[See Example](https://github.com/pusher/flutter_pusher_beams/tree/master/packages/pusher_beams/example)

## Prerequisites
In order to install this plugin, you must:

- Install [firebase_core](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core) package from [FlutterFire](https://firebase.flutter.dev/). ([See details](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview#installation))
- Install [firebase_messaging](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging) package from [FlutterFire](https://firebase.flutter.dev/). ([See details](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/overview#installation))
- Follow the instructions to initialize and configure Firebase on your Flutter application. ([See Details](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview#initializing-flutterfire)).
  - If you're installing this plugin within a fresh Flutter Application, you might use the [CLI initialization](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli)
  - If you're already using FlutterFire before the [dart-only initialization](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview#initializing-flutterfire), you may want to [migrate to dart-only](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/manual-installation#migrating-to-dart-only-initialization).
  
**Note: You may skip this if you have already installed [FlutterFire](https://firebase.flutter.dev/) and you're implementing [firebase_messaging](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging)** on your Flutter application.

### Android Additional
- [Enable Multidex](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/manual-installation/android#enabling-multidex) (If your `minSdkVersion` is lower than 21)

### iOS Additional
- [Setup iOS or macOS with Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/apple-integration) (You may want to read this)

## Installation
To install this plugin within you Flutter application, you need to add the package into your `pubspec.yaml`.
```yaml
    dependencies:
      pusher_beams: 1.0.0
```
or with `flutter pub`
```
flutter pub add pusher_beams
```

## Initialization

In order to initialize Pusher Beams, you already have initialized Firebase ([FlutterFire](https://firebase.flutter.dev/)), now you can initialize Pusher Beams using the `start` method as soon as possible (Preferable inside the `main` function).
```dart
void main() async {
  // Some initial code
  // Maybe the firebase initialization...
  
  await PusherBeams.instance.start('YOUR INSTANCE ID');
}
```

Overall, that's all! ✨ Now you can use the methods described in the [API Reference.](#api-reference)

## API Reference

If you want to see the API reference in-depth, you may want to see the [Official API Reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/pusher_beams/latest/) from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/).

## Contributing
In order to contribute you must first read [how to develop flutter plugins](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#plugin), this is the basic knowledge to start.

This repository is following [git flow branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), so in order to contribute, once you fork this project, you must create a _fix/_ or _feature/_ branch, which will be pull requested from you once it's ready.


Commits follows the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard, which scopes are the follow:

- **pusher_beams**: For [pusher_beams](https://github.com/pusher/flutter_pusher_beams/tree/master/packages/pusher_beams) code commits.
- **web**: For [pusher_beams_web](https://github.com/pusher/flutter_pusher_beams/tree/master/packages/pusher_beams_web) code commits.
- **ios**: For [pusher_beams_ios](https://github.com/pusher/flutter_pusher_beams/tree/master/packages/pusher_ios) code commits.
- **android**: For [pusher_beams_android](https://github.com/pusher/flutter_pusher_beams/tree/master/packages/pusher_beams_android) code commits.
- **interface**: For [pusher_beams_platform_interface](https://github.com/pusher/flutter_pusher_beams/tree/master/packages/pusher_beams_platform_interface) code commits.

So, in order to commit something you must use a commit message like below:

```
feat(android): i did something to android code :0
```

### Developing Environment
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) >= 2.x.x (running `flutter doctor` will check if everything is good to start)
- To contribute on [packages/pusher_beams_ios](packages/pusher_beams_ios) you must be in MacOS and Xcode must be installed

### Running The Tests
There's two major tests, our **app-facing package** test which is run as [Integration Test](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/integration-tests) and our **platform-interface package** test run as [Unit Test](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/flutter_test-library.html)

#### Integration Tests

For integration tests, we use the example app provided in `packages/pusher_beams/example`. In order to run the integration tests you must complete the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) in the example app which is...
- You already registered into [Pusher Beams](https://pusher.com/beams) platform.
- You already have a [Firebase Account](https://firebase.google.com/) linked with [Pusher Beams](https://pusher.com/beams)
- The [packages/pusher_beams/example](packages/pusher_beams/example) app is already set up and firebase is initialized.

If you already double-check the list above, then you must replace the constant `instanceId` located on `packages/pusher_beams/example/integration_test/pusher_beams_test.dart` with a real one from [Pusher Beams](https://pusher.com/beams).

```dart
// Code...

const instanceId = 'your-instance-id'; // Replace this with a real instanceId

// More Code...
```

So that's all! you can now run the integration test with the following command on the **example app path** (`packages/pusher_beams/example`):

```
flutter test integration_test
```

And for web (Do not forget to [read this](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction#5b-web)):

```
flutter drive \
  --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart \
  --target=integration_test/pusher_beams_test.dart \
  -d web-server
```

#### Unit Tests
In order to run unit tests for [packages/pusher_beams_platform_interface](packages/pusher_beams_platform_interface) you must be in the directory and run the following:
```
flutter test
```

### Pigeons
As this plugin platform interface is generated by [Pigeon](https://pub.dev/packages/pigeon) and if you modified the file [messages.dart](packages/pusher_beams_platform_interface/pigeons/messages.dart) from [packages/pusher_beams_platform_interface](packages/pusher_beams_platform_interface) package, in order to generate a new `MethodChannel` interface you must run the following command on path `packages/pusher_beams_platform_interface`:
```
make
```
After this command you must go to [packages/pusher_beams_platform_interface/lib/method_channel_pusher_beams.dart](packages/pusher_beams_platform_interface/lib/method_channel_pusher_beams.dart) and extends the class `PusherBeamsApi` with `PusherBeamsPlatform` like below:
```dart
class PusherBeamsApi extends PusherBeamsPlatform {
  // Pigeon Generated Class Code
}
```
This will require you to change the methods `onInterestChanges` and `setUserId` parameter `arg_callbackId` to type `dynamic` in order to accomplish `PusherBeamsPlatform` definition like below:
```dart
  // Class code...
  Future<void> onInterestChanges(dynamic arg_callbackId) async {
    // onInterestChanges generated function code...
  }

  Future<void> setUserId(String arg_userId, BeamsAuthProvider arg_provider, dynamic arg_callbackId) async {
    // setUserId generated function code...
  }
  // More class code...
```
